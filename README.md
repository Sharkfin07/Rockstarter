# Welcome to Rockstarter
This is my first ever game. It's a Text-based RPG game about a rockstar climbing the hierarchy of the music industry to achieve his true dream to become a rockstar. Game is made by a amateur developer, please expect some rough edges around the place.
# Main Menu Navigation

Think of these genres above as difficulties. They change the multiplier for every popularity you earn and skill you gain.  
Rock  - Not too mainstream, not too anti-mainstream. Multiplier: 1x  
Pop   - Mainstream music. Multiplier: 2x  
Rap   - Really mainstream music. Multiplier: 2.5x  
Metal - Small fanbase and extremely hard to learn. Multiplier: 0.5x  
Jazz  - Almost non-existant fanbase and REALLY hard to learn (trust me I've tried learning it before). Multiplier: 0.25x

Popularity: Indicates how popular you are, affects your status. More Popularity = More Salary  
Money:      Indicates how much money you have, if you are in debt it's game over.  
Skill:      Indicates how skilled you are. More skill = More popularity whilst releasing an album.  
Status:     The more popularity you have, the better your status.  
Salary:     You will be paid this amount of money every 3 days.  
Gamble:     Double it or lose it. Basically it's a 50/50 roulette.  
Do Nothing: Skip an entire day, with a 50/50 chance of robbers stealing money from you.
